Here’s what stood out once I put real players on the servers.\nTL;DR (Game-Dev Edition) #\rAWS Azure Game-specific PaaS GameLift (managed servers), GameSparks, IVS, Nimble Studio PlayFab (backend + LiveOps), Azure Gaming VMs Latency coverage 33 regions, Global Accelerator for UDP 65+ regions, Azure Front Door Anycast Burst scaling Spot fleets \u0026amp; GameLift FlexMatch auto-scale in 1–2 mins PlayFab Multiplayer Servers scale in ~3-4 mins Free egress 100 GB / month 100 GB / month Exclusive perks Graviton instances (cheap CPU) + Trainium GPUs Managed GPT-4o endpoints for in-game AI/NPCAI Azure for game back-ends #\rPlayFab – Drop-in player data, leaderboards, CloudScript, commerce, and LiveOps dashboards. Great for cross-platform titles (Xbox, PC, mobile). Azure Container Apps / AKS – Useful when you need custom match instances or authoritative physics servers. Azure Front Door + Anycast – Global entry point; auto-routes players to the nearest region and mitigates basic DDoS. Azure OpenAI Service – Handy for procedural dialogue or real-time moderation without juggling a separate OpenAI account. Cost gotchas\nLeaving a compute node in Stopped (Allocated) still bills vCPU/RAM—remember to deallocate. PlayFab’s free tier is generous for indies (up to 100 K MAU) but jumps sharply once you exceed limits. AWS for game back-ends #\rGameLift – Managed fleet + FlexMatch matchmaking. Per-second billing and built-in Spot capacity make it inexpensive for spiky player traffic. Global Accelerator – Anycast IPs with UDP acceleration; lowers first-hop latency for shooter or MOBA net-code. Graviton (Arm) EC2 – Up to 40 % cheaper CPU if your dedicated server binary builds for Arm. GameSparks – Managed player data \u0026amp; Cloud Code option if you prefer AWS over PlayFab. Cost perks\nWhen an EC2 instance or GameLift fleet is fully stopped, compute costs drop to zero—only EBS persists. 100 GB of free egress offsets patch distribution or CDN spillover. Head-to-head for common game scenarios #\rScenario Better fit Why Peer-hosted or server-authoritative FPS AWS GameLift low-latency UDP + Spot savings Cross-platform social RPG with LiveOps Azure PlayFab built-in economy, events, segmentation AI-driven NPC dialogue or toxicity filter Azure Azure OpenAI Service, no extra contracts Indie co-op title, dev budget \u0026lt; $50 / month Tie Both have free/spot tiers—AWS slightly easier to pause eSports tournament with strict region routing AWS Global Accelerator + latency-based routing Latency snapshots (my test cohort, May 2025) #\rUS East → Frankfurt AWS Global Accelerator: 84 ms average RTT Azure Front Door: 88 ms average RTT Tokyo → Sydney AWS: 111 ms Azure: 109 ms Both networks are neck-and-neck; route diversity matters more than absolute best case. Always test from your players’ ISPs. There are not much differences here\nFinal thoughts #\rGo Azure if you want PlayFab’s turnkey LiveOps or cheaper Windows licences, or you plan heavy AI integration via Azure OpenAI. Go AWS if you need per-second fleet scaling, aggressively stop servers in off-hours, or want to squeeze cost with Arm Spot instances. Whichever cloud you pick, measure first, refactor later. Long-running games live or die on latency and predictable bills.\nMore game-dev posts #\rMinecraft Server on AWS with Discord Integration #\rHow do i setup this website #\rMaintaining Blog Portfolio with Cloudflare and GitHub Actions\r2 mins\u0026middot;\rloading\r\u0026middot;\rloading\rFor Future Me #\rGame BaaS Comparison Spreadsheet\r","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/azure-vs-aws-overview/","section":"Posts","summary":"Why compare Azure and AWS for games? #\rI spun up both a multiplayer lobby service and a dedicated game-server fleet to measure cost, latency, and developer friction on each cloud.","title":"Azure vs AWS for Game Developers","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cloud/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cloud","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/comparison/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Comparison","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/games/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Games","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/multiplayer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Multiplayer","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"In this post I’ll walk through how my Hugo-based blog, powered by the Blowfish theme, is automatically built and deployed to Cloudflare Pages every time I push to main.\nArchitecture at a Glance #\r%%{ init { \"theme\": \"default\", \"themeVariables\": { \"textColor\": \"#ffffff\" } } }%%\rarchitecture-beta\rgroup site_pipeline(cloud)[Static Site Pipeline]\rservice markdown(logos:markdown)[Markdown Content] in site_pipeline\rservice hugo(devicon:hugo)[Hugo Static Builder] in site_pipeline\rservice github(logos:github-actions)[GitHub Actions CI] in site_pipeline\rservice cloudflare(devicon:cloudflare)[Cloudflare CDN] in site_pipeline\rmarkdown:R --\u003e L:hugo\rhugo:R --\u003e L:github\rgithub:R --\u003e L:cloudflare\rStatic site generator: Hugo + Blowfish theme Source control: GitHub CI/CD: GitHub Actions Hosting \u0026amp; DNS: Cloudflare Pages + a custom .com domain registered through Cloudflare GitHub Actions Workflow #\rSo since I use static site generator with full control over the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, even the content management service is handled by hugo with Makrdown language and a flexible shortcode by Blowfish Theme.

So let\u0026rsquo;s break it down what is Marvel Snap.\nMarvel Snap, developed by Second Dinner Studios and published by Nuverse, has emerged as a fast-paced collectible card game sensation. This review delves into the captivating world of Marvel Snap, where players construct superhero teams and engage in strategic battles across both PC and mobile platforms.\nOverview #\rMarvel Snap unfolds in the Marvel Universe, featuring beloved characters like Hulk, Spiderman, and Nightcrawler. Players, armed with their own decks, vie for supremacy in a game that spans just six turns, ensuring quick, action-packed gameplay.\nObjective #\rThe primary goal is to secure two out of the three central locations on the game board by the final turn. Success hinges on outsmarting opponents and maximizing power at each location.\nGameplay #\rThe simultaneous completion of turns injects excitement into every moment, making Marvel Snap an ideal on-the-go game, especially for mobile devices.\nCards #\rEach card in Marvel Snap has a Energy and Power value assigned to it. You start off by creating your deck with the cards available to you. Winning duels will reward you with credits and card boosters, which you can use to upgrade your card rarity.\nLocations #\rThere are three locations in the center of the game board. Each location has a different effect that will help or hinder your strategy based on your card deck. The location will be revealed one by one every turn. So you have to adapt your strategy based on the location. There are over 140 locations in the game, so you have to be prepared for anything.\nSnap! #\rSnap is a mechanic that will be unlocked after you play the game for a while. It\u0026rsquo;s a special move that doubles your reward if you win the duel. But if you lose, you will lose double of your rewards too. So you have to be careful when using this feature. It\u0026rsquo;s apply to both player, so you can use this for psychological warfare.\nFun Factor #\rPrevious\rNextsads\rWhy this game is so fun and addictive? Let\u0026rsquo;s break it down.\nSimple Gameplay #\rThe rules, initially appearing complex, quickly become intuitive with an interactive tutorial, making Marvel Snap easy to learn and play. The game\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced nature, with each turn lasting only 30 seconds, ensures that players are constantly engaged. The game\u0026rsquo;s short duration also makes it ideal for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy a quick game on the go.\nVisuals and Sound Effects #\rStunning visuals exemplified in every unique card, contribute to a captivating gaming experience. The game\u0026rsquo;s vibrant colors and dynamic animations further enhance the visual appeal every turn you play or interact with the game. The music however, is a bit repetitive and could be improved, such as adding more tracks or allowing players to choose their own music, just like what Valve did on Counter-Strike 2. Unlike the music, the sound effects are well-designed and add to the overall experience. Especially the sound effects of the cards, which are unique to each card and are very satisfying to hear.\nCard Collection and Leveling System #\rSince Marvel Snap has a lot of cards, it\u0026rsquo;s make the game more dynamic and fun. You cannot expect what card your opponent will play next. So it feels like a gamble, but a fun gamble. The extensive card variety and leveling system, achievable through in-game currency or casual play, add dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game. Player could upgrade their cards to higher rarity, which won\u0026rsquo;t increase the power of the card, but will unlock new card animations and sound effects.\nRegular Updates and Active Community #\rBased on SteamDB accesed on January 2024, Marvel Snap has a very active playerbase and a great number of positive reviews. The game is also available on mobile devices, which further expands its playerbase. Frequent updates, including new cards, locations, cosmetics, and events, maintain Marvel Snap\u0026rsquo;s freshness. The active community on Discord and Reddit r/MarvelSnap further enhances the gaming experience.\nConclusion #\rMarvel Snap successfully combines unique mechanics with engaging content. As a free-to-play game, it strikes a balance between monetization and enjoyable gameplay. With its fast-paced, action-packed nature, Marvel Snap proves to be an ideal companion for gaming on the go.\n","date":"24 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/deconstruct-marvel-snap/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction #\rIt\u0026rsquo;s probably too late for me to deconstruct Marvel Snap since the game is classified as high end that take about 4gigs storage both mobile and desktop.

Pandemic #\rJust like others, online school is boring. So i started to learn game development. I started with Godot Engine since its lite and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a lot of resources. I started with a simple game, a platformer game.\nAGI #\rThen coincidentally a few months later AGI held a Game Development Competition. So i decided to join the competition. The theme of the competition is Educational Game for Vocational Training. I made an educational game about coffee industry for Kementerian Ketenagakerjaan, it narrates how Luwak made coffee from coffee plantation. Won second place despite being the only high school and able to beat a team of 3 people from vocational high school by myself, it was turning point for me.\nHere is the clip of the game called Luwak Adventure that i made:\nCompfest 14 #\rAfter the competition, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s Compfest 14. I formed a small team consist of 3 people. We decided to make a game about metroidvania. For 30 days of struggle sadly we didn\u0026rsquo;t make it through the final. But we still proud of our work and we try to do it better next time. Mainly i\u0026rsquo;m the one who did the game design, UI programming, and some of the art. Deka for the more complex programming such as the platformer physics, game mechanics, he also compose the music and draw the main character. Others is Zio for pixel artist and Azfa for additional programming and level design.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called May I Return that we made:\nGACCI 2022 #\rAfter Compfest 14, i decided to join another competition. This time it\u0026rsquo;s GACCI 2022. Another competition show up, this time it\u0026rsquo;s a competition held by Binus University. This competition is a bit different from the previous one. This time we have to make a game design document(which i never did before), so i eager to learn what is game design document. I got into the final and some of my friends from AGI Competition also get into the final. We have to do sort of game pitching for the jury. I got the 1st place and my friends got the 2nd place. Apparently i made it to the final because of my game design document is the longest and the most complex one. I tried to make a fusion game of Papers Please and Cooking Mama on Indonesian Independence Day theme. The prize is a fullscholarship for Binus University.\nGIM JAM ITB 2023 #\rIt\u0026rsquo;s a 7 days game jam basicly, with the theme of \u0026ldquo;Meme Indonesia\u0026rdquo;. I made a game about Meth, Magician, and Latto-latto. Because meme is vary, i decided to put 3 meme in one game. I made it to become the Winner of Best Game Award. I made this game with Deka, Zio. We made this game using kinematic skeleton to animate the character, it\u0026rsquo;s save a lot of time.\nGlobal Game Jam 2023 #\rIt\u0026rsquo;s a 48 hours offline game jam with \u0026ldquo;Root\u0026rdquo; as a theme. The event supported by GameLan.YK, I made the level design based on the Team Lead direction and searched for some audio assets for the game. I met a lot of new people and had a lot of fun, we got a visit from Kementerian Pariwisata dan Ekonomi Kreatif, Muhammad Neil El Himam and Sandiaga Uno.\nHere is the clip of the game we made called Stay Hydrated! that we made:\nand here is the recap of the event:\nTono #\rMy experiment for 3D game, probably my shamest work. I made this game for Vocachamp 2023. Made with the new Godot Engine 4, 3D assets with Blender, audio with BeepBox, drawing with Krita, video editing software with KDEnLive. I made a Hamster Ball game like. Beside my shamest work i also proud of this work because i made it all by myself. I made the 3D assets, the music, the sound effect, the game design, the programming, the level design, the UI, the video editing, and the game trailer.
