__Why this game is so fun and addictive? Let's break it down.__

### Simple Gameplay

The rules, initially appearing complex, quickly become intuitive with an interactive tutorial, making Marvel Snap easy to learn and play. The game's fast-paced nature, with each turn lasting only 30 seconds, ensures that players are constantly engaged. The game's short duration also makes it ideal for mobile devices, allowing players to enjoy a quick game on the go.

### Visuals and Sound Effects

Stunning visuals exemplified in every unique card, contribute to a captivating gaming experience. The game's vibrant colors and dynamic animations further enhance the visual appeal every turn you play or interact with the game. The music however, is a bit repetitive and could be improved, such as adding more tracks or allowing players to choose their own music, just like what Valve did on [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.counter-strike.net/cs2). Unlike the music, the sound effects are well-designed and add to the overall experience. Especially the sound effects of the cards, which are unique to each card and are very satisfying to hear.

### Card Collection and Leveling System

The extensive card variety and leveling system, achievable through in-game currency or casual play, add dynamic and unpredictable elements to the game.
