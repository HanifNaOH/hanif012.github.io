I've been developing game since 2020. You could check my game on Itch.io, or you could check my projects on this website. I also have a blog where I write about things I'm interested in, and I try to keep it up to date.
You can browse my [blog posts](/posts/) on this website.

If you want to get in touch, you can reach me via Discord or email. I'm always open to discussing game design, programming, or any other topics related to interactive experiences.
