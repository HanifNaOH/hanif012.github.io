## About the Game

Lore's Quests is a simple and lighthearted 2D ragdoll physics game in which you play as a jester trying to entertain and pander to each and every whim of the King Lore-Lore in order to stay alive. Usually this means doing normal tricks with your body movement or popping balloony, what's the worst thing could happen?
